## What are quality tactics?

Quality Tactics are specific methods, practices, or design decisions applied throughout the software lifecycle to achieve or improve a targeted quality characteristic. They encompass both technical implementations (how the system is built) and process-oriented techniques (how the system is defined, validated or deployed) to ensure the software effectively satisfies its intended purpose.
